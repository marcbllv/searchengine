- A user enters a query
- on the results list, he picks the relevant documents
- we compute the precision VS #results graph
- we compute the precision-recall graph for these results
- we use relevant feedback with the relevant documents
- we compute the precision VS #results graph again
- we compute the precision-recall graph again
