best results because specific on mathematics. A lot of documents contain
"mathematics" and "program", but a few of them contain "statistics" without
being specific on maths.
And meanwhile, documents talking on mathematics graduate programs often have
links to other maths programs including "statistics".

Why can we not simply set the query to be the entire information need
description ?
Because the sentance "Info about the education in Mathematics
on a graduate level at UCDavis" contains a lot of insignificant words (about,
the, on, a, ...) which are the stopwords. We could remove the stopwords and
come to a query like "education mathematics graduate level UCDavis" (actually
this is still too specific, and "education mathematics graduate" is better, as
seen above)
